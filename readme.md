<h1>Movie recommendation system using correlation </h1>

<p> In this project I have taken the average of ratings for all the movies and then have applied the concept of correlation to relate it with the number of users who has rated the movies and after that we have sorted everything based on the correlation value and after that we have chosen all the values in which minimum ratting is >= 150 and displayed the top 5 results from the list . </p>

<ul>
<li>Dataset used = <a href=""https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/"">movielen 100k dataset</a></li>
<li>We have only deal with the u.data and u.item tables from the dataset .</li>
</ul>

<p>Its just a sample program so the accuracy may change .</p>
